<p align="center">Welcome to KEC Works.

   
Here at KEC Works we make locomotives for use in Garry's Mod.

Warning: KEC Works locomotives use an old RLC and thus aren't compatible with RLC PT1 or PT2

## To Install Dupes:

1. To download the current roster, click on the green "Code" button and then "Download Zip".
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "KEC-works-main" Folder. You should see two items: a folder named "KEC WORKS LOCOMOTIVES" and readme.md.
4. Extract the folder named "KEC WORKS LOCOMOTIVES" directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2\`.
   
If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the AdvancedDuplicator 2, and click the green "Update" button at the top on the lefthand side of the window.

## To Install E2's:
1. To download the current E2's, click on the green "Code" button and then "Download Zip".
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "KEC-works-main" Folder. You should see a few items: a folder named "KEC WORKS LOCOMOTIVES", a folder named "Heros-funky-Throttle-and-bits-pack" and readme.md.
4. Extract "Heros-funky-Throttle-and-bits-pack" directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\Heros-funky-Throttle-and-bits-pack\...` etc.
5. If you see the folder "KEC-works-main" inside the "expression2" folder, __YOU INSTALLED IT WRONG__ and the E2s will not work!
   
If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the lefthand side of the window.
